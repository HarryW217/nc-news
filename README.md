# NC News

###### A News App...

## Project Summary

'NC News' is an attempt at coding and deploying a front-end application. Its purpose is to allow users to navigate a database of articles. This can be done by filtering by a specific topic, sorting the articles by a specified property and even changing the order they are listed.

There is also interactivity in this app; a user account has been hardcoded to allow visitors to upvote or downvote an article, and post and delete comments.

## Back-end server

This project makes use of the API News back-end server I developed, which you can also take a look at on my Github profile: https://github.com/HarryW217/API-news

## Hosted Version

The app is hosted using Netlify. Have a visit yourself here: INSERT LINK
